ReadMe for Print2PDF.prg
Last Updated July, 2008 by Paul James of Life-Cycle Technologies, Inc.

**-> If you encounter problems, read the comments at the top of Print2Pdf.PRG <-**

The actual program code is very heavily documented, please look there for details.
To try out the functionality, simply run P2Demo.prg from within VFP.
This code was tested under VFP 6, 7, 8, and 9.

If you do not have a Generic Postscript printer driver installed, the demo
will automatically install it for you.  Also, if you do not have Ghostscript
installed, the demo will automatically install it also.

Once you have run the Demo, you can delete the files p2demo*.* and books.*

I hope this code is beneficial to you as it is a small contribution 
by me to the development community that has given me so much.

Thank You!
